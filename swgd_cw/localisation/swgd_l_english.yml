 START_SCREEN_MANDO:0 "Mand'alor the Indomitable has fallen.\n\nAfter being taken down by enemy fire and crash landing on Onderon's moon, Dxun, his bloodied and torn corpse was found. Reports say he fought bravely, but eventually succumbed to the moon's dangerous creatures.\n\nBut not all is lost, the mask has been found. While combing the jungles for our fallen leader, there was one who came upon the Mand'alor's mask and, in accordance with our traditions, has claimed it as his own to become the new Mand'alor.\n\nThe people now call upon our Mand'alor once more to lead them to battle and conquest.

Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.\n\nWill you take your people into a new golden age among the stars? Or will you seek other goals?"
