 CAPTURE_QUEEN_DESC:0 "After a recent space battle in the [queen_system.GetName] system, a Yuuzhan Vong Queen was badly injured and left for dead by the rest of the Vong. The creature is still alive, however. Capturing it would be a major intelligence coup."

 guardian.515.c.reply:0 "They were your masters once, and ours. Their name is no longer known by the younger races, but they were the Rakata. Their Infinite Empire used their potent Force-powered technologies to conquer and enslave every other species they came across throughout the known galaxy. They must have been fond of puzzles and enigmas. The only items recovered from the fortress in the past are metal shapes used in contraptions inside, to be rearranged to some satisfactory solutions. Those who brought them back did so because they failed and barely escaped with their lives. Many others didn't."
 
 guardian.3001:0 "Horror in the Void"
 guardian.3001.desc:0 "We have encountered some kind of vast entity near [horror_system.GetName], swirling with dark side energy. It appears to exist only partially inside our own universe, with the bulk of the creature still trapped in whatever nightmarish realm it spawned from.\n\nThere is a malevolent intelligence at work here, ancient beyond our concept of time and utterly alien in its design. We can only guess as to its purpose."
 guardian.3001.a:0 "I have a bad feeling about this."
 guardian.3003.desc:2 "The dark side entity which attempted to breach our universe near [guardians_horror_system.GetName] has been banished back into its own realm. Only time will tell if its influence has been sufficiently weakened to keep it there for good.\n\nWe are detecting some kind of anomalous residual energy that must have been left behind by the dimensional rifts the creature opened. Studying this dark side energy more closely could potentially lead to scientific breakthroughs."
 guardian.3004.intro:2 "Our study of the dark side energy anomalies produced by the [guardians_horror_system.GetName] dimensional rifts has finally yielded results. The energies involved in the creation of these portals are unlike any we have ever encountered."
