# All leaders will have a common trait-point value set in defines, which they use to grab traits

# leader_trait = yes - this tags the trait as a leader-trait and not a species-trait
# initial = no - if set to no, this trait can not be granted to leaders when they are generated
# leader_class = { admiral scientist }  -- OR  - if not set, it can be given to all leader-types except Rulers
# requires_traits = { trait_psionic } -- AND - leader-trait can only be randomly given on generation if the leaders species has this trait
# requires_governments = { despotic_hegemony ai_overlordship } -- OR - leader-trait can only be randomly given on generation if the Empire has this type of government form
# prerequisites = { tech_psionic_theory } - AND - leader-trait can only be given if the technology specified has been researched by the Empire
